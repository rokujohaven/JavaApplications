//	6. Finally
//
//	Change the Grades[]  variable in your Student class to hold  an array of Integer instead of an array of int , and change the  GPA variable to hold a Double object instead of a double primitive. Make any necessary changes to your getters setters, contractors and methods in your main class so they work with the new data types of you class variable.
//	Please write a method that takes a string and initializes a Student object using the information found within the string. The information in the string will be as follows: 
//	StudentName, [grade1, grade2, grade3], [courseCode, subject, InstructorName]
//	For example :
//	String s="Pedro Peres, [100,95,80], [Cis-101, Java, James]";
//	String s = "Steve Smit, [90, 70,55, 40,80], [Cis-203, Java Developer, Marcial]";
	
//	Step 7:
//	In your main method create an array of strings  filled with 10 strings of data in the same format as the ones we used in step 6 ("Pedro Peres, [100,95,80], [Cis-101, Java, James]") and create 10 instances of Student using the data from that array (by making use of the method you created in step 6)
//
//	Create a method that takes an array of Student object as arguments and print the name and GPA of each student with GPA above the average
//	Create a method that takes an int n and array of Student object as arguments and print the name and GPA of the n higest GPAs of within the array of Students
//	Create a method that takes an int n and array of Student object as arguments and prints the n Courses with the highest average GPAs based on the students that are taking that class
